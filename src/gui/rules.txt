Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board,
and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board.

The game starts with Player X playing wherever they want.
This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative location.
For example, if Player X played in the top right square of some local board,
then Player O needs to play next in the top right local board.
Player O can then play in any of the available spots in that local board,
each move sending Player X to a different local board.

If a move is played so that it is to win a local board
by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a
victory for the player in the global board.

Once the outcome of a local board is decided (win or draw),
no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board,
then that player may play in any other board.

Game play ends when either a player wins the global board
or there are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw.
